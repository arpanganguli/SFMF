# SFMF
## Introduction
This repository models the single factor and multi factor credit risk portfolio distribution for commercial loans.
## Repository Structure
The repository is arranged in following directories:

* **code:** contains all the code for simulating both single and multi factor credit risk models.
* **data:** contains the data for portfolio equity returns and covariance matrix.
* **export:** contains the output of both single and multi factor credit risk models.
## Outputs
